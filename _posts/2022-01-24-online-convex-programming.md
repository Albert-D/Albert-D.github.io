In this paper, the author presented effective gradient descent algorithms to solve the online convex programming problem. 
Online convex programming is a generalization of the well-studied experts problem. The author fisrt eastablished a Greedy 
Projection algorithm, and prove the average regret of Greedy Projection approaches zero. Then they defined a different 
Lazy Projection algorithm which also had a well performance. The repeated games is established as online linear programming 
problems in their work, and the application of their algorithm is universally consistent. Fianlly, they showed how to 
translate algorithms for mixing experts into algorithms for online convex programs.
